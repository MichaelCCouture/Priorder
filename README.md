# Priorder
Priorder is an app for Android that provdies a way for students to keep track of upcoming assignments and tests (regarded as “tasks”), and to assist them in organizing and prioritizing their work. Priorder will list the student’s tasks in order of due date, so the student can see which upcoming task is going to be due next. The student can add a new task to the list by selecting from a list of their task types, and entering a category, a due date, a grade weight, and any notes they wish to record about the task.
